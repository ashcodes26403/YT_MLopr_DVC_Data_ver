1. Create a github repo and clone it
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. (It will save a csv file to a new data folder)
3. # pip install dvc
4. now we do dvc init
5. now make mdkir s3" (creates new s3 directory)
6. now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/"
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"  
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. Now make changes to mycode.py file to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
11. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
12. Then git add commit push (were saving V2 of our data at this point)
13. check dvc/git status, everything should be up to date
14. Now repear 10-12 for V3 of data
